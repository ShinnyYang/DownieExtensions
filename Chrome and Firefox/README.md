There are two versions of extensions - ones with manifest v2 (old style) and ones with manifest v3 (new style).

These versions are not interchangeable. 

As of Apr 3, 2022:

- v3 is supported on Chrome 88+, Chromium and some selected Chrome-based browsers
- v2 is supported on all Chrome-based browsers, including Brave and Opera
