There are two versions of extensions - ones with manifest v2 (old style) and ones with manifest v3 (new style).

These versions are not interchangeable. 

As of Oct 7, 2025:

- v3 is supported on Chrome, Chromium and most Chrome-based browsers, including Brave
- v2 is now deprecated, new features will not be included.
